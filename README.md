This project requires:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ "Docker")
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ "Docker-compose")

## How It Works
* **Apache**
    * Apache is the most commonly used Web server on Linux systems. Web servers are used to serve Web pages requested by client computers. 
    * Clients typically request and view Web pages using Web browser applications such as Firefox, Opera, Chromium, or Internet Explorer.


## Running
    * After installing Docker and Docker-compose just run the following command:

> docker-compose up

    * After running check your browse acessing localhost, for default is configured to access port 80
